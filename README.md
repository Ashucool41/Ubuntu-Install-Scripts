# Ubuntu-Install-Scripts
These are the personal scripts I use to set my Ubuntu up as quick as possible.

Feel free to fork them them and modify them if you like them

## Usage instructions
Run 
`chmod +x *.sh` to make all scripts executable
Then execute them in the terminal in the sequence of filenames.
